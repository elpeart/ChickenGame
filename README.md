# Chicken Game Tester

This project tests how likely winning and losing are in the children's boardgame "Count Your Chicks"
The goal of the game is to get all of the chicks into the coop before reaching the end. 
The spinner has 6 possible outcomes. Five correspond to pictures on spaces on the board and direct the player to move to the next space with that picture, while one has a fox. Each space moved allows the player to put one chick in the coop.  When the spinner lands on the fox, however, one chick is removed from the coop. There are 40 chicks and 40 spaces, with some spaces allowing an extra chick to be moved to the coop.

The program plays the game 10,000 times and reports the number of wins and losses.
